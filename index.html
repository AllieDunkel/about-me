            <h2>Job Experience</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I have worked in retail most of my life. I started working at Dairy Queen at age 15.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>As of right now, I do not have any goals, other than finish this course, get a job, and move to Seattle Washington. I love the rain and am not a fan of the sun and would love to live in a place where it rains all the time. I did have goals that included going to graduate school and becoming a Neuropsychologist. However, after I got rejected, I just want to have a full-time job so I can stop calling myself a "broke college student".</li>
