            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                I was born in Manchester, Iowa. I do not remember most of my child. I did not live with my biological mother and father. I lived with my stepmom for most of it and we moved once a year to different states, therefore, a lot of my memories are foggy. 
                I was put into the Foster Care System at age 15 and that is when my memories become clearer. I lived in Farley IA and went to Western Dubuque High School. After that I went to college at Mount Mercy University.

            <h2>Job Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I have worked in retail most of my life. I started working at Dairy Queen at age 15. I also worked at Total Fitness, Kwik Star, Lumber Specialties, Pizza Hut, Office Max, Starbucks, Shopko, and Dunkin Donuts. The only job that did not involve talking with customers was Lumber Specialties. Lumber Specialties was considered a manual labor job.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                As of right now, I do not have any goals, other than finish this course, get a job, and move to Seattle Washington. I love the rain and am not a fan of the sun and would love to live in a place where it rains all the time. I did have goals that included going to graduate school and becoming a Neuropsychologist. However, after I got rejected, I just want to have a full-time job so I can stop calling myself a "broke college student".
